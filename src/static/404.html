    <h2>"The School Day Drag"</h2>
    <br>
    <a>I drag myself out of bed, it's way too early,<br>
       My brain's still asleep, and my eyes are all blurry.<br>
       The sun isn't up, but they want me to be,<br>
       Why can't they just let me stay in my dreams?</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a>The classroom's a cage, the clock barely ticks,<br>
       Hours crawl by, it's a terrible trick.<br>
       Math is confusing, history's a bore,<br>
       Do I really need to know what's come before?</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a>Teachers drone on like robots on repeat,<br>
       Assignments pile up—there’s no time to breathe.<br>
       Homework, exams, stress on a loop,<br>
       I’m sinking deep in this never-ending soup.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a>Recess is short, lunch is a joke,<br>
       And don't get me started on those cafeteria folks.<br>
       We wait all day for that freedom bell,<br>
       But when it rings, we’re still trapped in this spell.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a>They say it’s for learning, to help me succeed,<br>
       But all I want is some freedom, a little less speed.<br>
       Because school feels like prison, with no escape hatch,<br>
       Just waiting for weekends—the ultimate catch.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a>So here’s to the books, and the tests that I’ll fail,<br>
       To waking up early, and feeling so frail.<br>
       I’ll get through it, somehow, I guess,<br>
       But right now, school? It’s just a mess.</a>
